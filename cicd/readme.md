# CICD Demo script

## Setup

 1. Create an Openshift Project

 2. Install Tekton/Pipeline Operator in your Cluster

 3. Fork and Clone this repo

 4. Apply the Openshift Pipelines (Tekton) Resources

### 4.1 Create Tekton resources into your project namespace
```
oc create -f tekton-resources/

configmap/custom-maven-settings created
eventlistener.triggers.tekton.dev/ba-cicd-event-listener created
persistentvolumeclaim/maven-repo-pvc created
task.tekton.dev/mvn-jkube created
task.tekton.dev/mvn created
pipeline.tekton.dev/ba-cicd-pipeline created
persistentvolumeclaim/source-workspace-pvc created
triggerbinding.triggers.tekton.dev/ba-cicd-trigger-binding created
triggertemplate.triggers.tekton.dev/ba-cicd-trigger-template created	
```

The following resources should be created in your namespace:

* PVCs for maven and git repos
	* maven-repo-pvc
	* shared-workspace
* ConfigMap with a custom Maven settings.xml
* Tekton Resources
	* Event Listener
	* Triggers
	* Template
	* Binding
	* Tasks
	* Pipeline

If you open the Pipelines view in the Openshift Developer Dashboard you should see the `ba-cicd-pipeline`
![Pipeline View	](docs/pipelines-view.png)

Click the `ba-cicd-pipeline` to see its details with a graphical representation.

### 4.2 Expose the Pipeline Event Listener
In order to trigger a *Pipeline Run* with a *Git Push event* you need to expose your Pipeline **EventListener**

```
oc expose svc el-ba-cicd-event-listener
route.route.openshift.io/el-ba-cicd-event-listener exposed	
```

Open the Topology view in the Developer Dashboard to see the Trigger Event Listener POD

  <img src="docs/pipeline-trigger-event-listener.png">
</p>


This is the service that listen to your git hook events (via webhooks)!

### 4.3 Create the Git Webhook to trigger your Pipeline
Get the EventListener URL:

```
echo "$(oc  get route el-ba-cicd-event-listener --template='http://{{.spec.host}}')"
http://el-ba-cicd-event-listener-rhpam-sandbox.your.cluster.domain.com
```

### 4.4 Go to the (forked) Project Settings in your github and add a Webhook. 
* Set the Payload URL with the Pipeline EventListener URL copied previously.
* Set the Content type as `application/json`

### Trigger the Pipeline execution
 Open the [decisions-showcase](../decisions-showcase) project and make some changes in your Business Assets (eg: change a rule/decision definition) and push it to your git repo.
> **Remember** to change the artifact version in the `pom.xml`

```
  <groupId>com.redhat.demos</groupId>
  <artifactId>decisions-showcase</artifactId>
  <version>1.1.0-SNAPSHOT</version>
```

Commit and push
```
git commit -am "applying some changes"
git push origin master
```

At this point the **git push webhook** previously configured for your repo should be activated...
![Git Webhook activated](docs/github-webhook-payload.png)

And consequently a new **Pipeline Run** should be triggered in the Openshift as well...
![Pipeline Event triggered](docs/pipeline-run-status.png)

Click the `Pipeline Runs` tab to see your Pipeline executions
![Pipeline Runs](docs/pipeline-run-status-2.png)

Click on the active execution to follow the run status
![Pipeline Event triggered](docs/pipeline-status-3.png)

Click on the `Logs` tab to see the output of each individual task execution
![Pipeline task logs](docs/pipeline-run-task-logs.png)

## Access the Business Application Service

At the end of the Pipeline execution you should have two instances of your Kie Server running on Spring Boot containers.
![Kie Server SB POD](docs/kie-server-pods-topology.png)

click on the POD edge arrow to open the public App Route URL

</p>

You should see the sample Business Application Service home page
![Kie Server home page](docs/business-service-app.png)

exposing the standard Kie Server API

## Build a custom Tekton Maven Task image
To be able to use JKube Maven Plugin I extended the standard Tekton Maven image to include the `oc` CLI tool.

```
docker build -f docker/mvn-with-oc-task.dockerfile \ 
--no-cache \ 
--build-arg OC_PKG_URL="https://mirror.openshift.com/pub/openshift-v4/clients/oc/latest/linux/oc.tar.gz" \
-t quay.io/rafaeltuelho/mvn-kube-oc:openjdk-11 .
```

> NOTE: this image is publicly available in my Quay.io repo: https://quay.io/repository/rafaeltuelho/mvn-kube-oc
> No need to do anything here.

## Clean up your namespace
To delete the application provisioned y the Pipeline Run, execute the following command.

```
oc delete all -l provider=jkube -n <namespace>

pod "business-application-service-1-9nl6j" deleted
pod "business-application-service-1-tnqth" deleted
replicationcontroller "business-application-service-1" deleted
service "business-application-service" deleted
deploymentconfig.apps.openshift.io "business-application-service" deleted
buildconfig.build.openshift.io "business-application-service-s2i" deleted
build.build.openshift.io "business-application-service-s2i-1" deleted
imagestream.image.openshift.io "business-application-service" deleted
route.route.openshift.io "business-application-service" deleted
```
